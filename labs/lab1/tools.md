# Description of 10 Data Management Tools

+ The frist data management tool that was found online is Databib. This tool essentially is a means to find databases already filled with research data for you to use for your own analysis. This would be useful if you wanted to conduct a research project but did not have the time or resources to collect data. This tool is mostly focused on storing and accessing data rather than modifying it.

+ Lumify is another data management tool, but this one focuses on visualizing data. It allows the user to show 2D and 3D graphics to better show what the data is saying by depciting it visually. This tool therefore does not modify values of data but simply accesses it for viewing purposes.

+ Apache storm is a tool that allows for distributed computation of data, therefore it allows access and modification. Due to its distribtued nature it allows data to be managed across several systems at a single time.

+ Apache Drill is a tool that allows SQL querrying of data and therefore accesses and modifys data. This is useful for inputing data into applications or taking data from applications as output for further analysis.

+ Apache Samoe is a tool that specializes in data mining and machine learning. This tool therefore can take large data sets and find trends through continuous analysis of the data, since this tool also specializes in machine learning, it should be expected to get better and be more efficient in identifying data trends with the more data it has been given.

+ Elasticsearch is a distributed tool that helps manage reliability and scalibility of systems. Due to this tool being distributed it is useful for managaing database systems that are managed over several systems. Information about this system was found at http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/data-management/9-useful-open-source-big-data-tools.html

+ Apache Solr is a database search system that allows for distributed management of data. It allows the user to locate where data is within the distributed network and focuses on reliablity, scalability, and fault tolerance of distirbuted databases.
