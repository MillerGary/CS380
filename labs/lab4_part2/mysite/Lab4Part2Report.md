# Lab 4 Part 2 Report

+ Gary Miller

## Difficulties
Personally, I did not have too many difficulties when attempting to complete this lab. By using the slides from class I was easily able to adapt the code given into what was needed to be delivered for the lab. The only trouble I came across when completing this lab was some semantic errors in the python code, which is likely due to the fact that I predominantly code in Java. At first I was having an issue entering values for attributes that were more than one word long, I was getting a syntax error thrown on the space character. By eventual this issue was fixed by entering all of the data to be inserted into an array and using the executemany function opposed to the execute function I was using before, and this prevented any errors from being thrown. Also, I had to make sure that the table is dropped and recreated each time in order to prevent duplicate entries. Overall I thought this was a fun lab and I have learned a lot by becoming familiar with the django system.
